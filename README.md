# mcwaypointman

For when you're too lazy to write down coordinates manually,
but also too lazy to install [an actual waypoint mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap).

Yes, this is reinventing the wheel, yes this is stupid.

## usage

`waypointman.py [-h] [-v] output`

* `-h`, `--help`: display help
* `-v`, `--verbose`: set the logging level to debug
* `output`: output waypoints file

## epilogue

You know what, I'll just install a waypoint mod. I think.

I think, I think I'll do that. Tomorrow. Yeah.
